usual deal
make main, make tests
implement this as your own version of the vector class
name it myvector
templated class
show that it works with ints and strings
and i don't know all the calls 
i'd like this to be array backed, so you're going to have an array internally that will be your data store
resizing should happen automatically, and should be growing.
shouldn't actually call resize, should be private and happen automatically
never shrink it
insert at a location, insert at the end, and should be able to delete from a location that compresses it
