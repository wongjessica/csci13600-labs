usual deal<br>
make main, make tests<br>
implement this as your own version of the vector class<br>
name it myvector<br>
templated class<br>
show that it works with ints and strings<br>
and i don't know all the calls <br>
i'd like this to be array backed, so you're going to have an array internally that will be your data store<br>
resizing should happen automatically, and should be growing.<br>
shouldn't actually call resize, should be private and happen automatically<br>
never shrink it
insert at a location, insert at the end, and should be able to delete from a location that compresses it<br>
