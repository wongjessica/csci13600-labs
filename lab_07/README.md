For Joseph's code, I found it odd that there was a space between every single line of code. 
It was either his intention, or that it's just how Xcode decided to open it.
For smaller systems, it would be more difficult to open the code and edit due to the file having 2x the lines of code.

Also, the difficult part I found was the single-letter variables. I did not know what they represented, so I didn't know what to change the variable name to. For example, he made 
```string w, after;``` 
and I did not know what w meant at first. Then I realized that it could mean "word", but I feel as if it could have been more explicit.

However I liked some of his comments. One part he commented ```//end of main```. At first I thought it was pointless, but then I realized how useful it actually was: to differentiate the main from the rest of the functions.
