I keep making mistakes regarding to creating the C++ class (as of 10:43AM 8/30/18), I hope my code will work if it's as C++ source file
As of 10:56AM 8/30/18 I am trying to code it, but it consistently tells me I have a syntax error and duplicate declarations of variables,
so I am trying to fix it so that my code will at least be able to compile.
